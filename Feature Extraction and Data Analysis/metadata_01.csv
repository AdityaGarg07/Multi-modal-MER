im a failure addicted to pu*****ng paraphernalia but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once innocence disappeared by the age of eight years my pops shot up drug related mama addicted so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging blood was staining the concrete older *****s i loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet that slow money picked up the family business by the age of thirteen six years later was handed sentence round the same time is when you came in this world me and your mama thinking what the ***** we naming this girl i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was nineteen took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked ass system set for me and now i fear its too late for me to

young *****s blasting frustrated cause the cash running out *****s dont know how to act in a drought see baby girl i realized my definition of a real ***** was skewed my views misshaped by new mixtapes that confirmed the *****t i learned in the streets was true that real *****s dont speak when they beef with you they just pull up on your street let the heat at you and if a real ***** hungry he gon eat your food i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you i pray you find a ***** with goals and point of views much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you into a box where your son dont even know his pops and the cyclical nature of doing time continues my worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon and sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true but maybe theres a chance that its not and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels and i can teach you this in person like im teaching you to tie your own shoes i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you for your eyes only hook for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand verse 4 one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling what hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling i tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling he said jermaine i knew you since we was children i never asked for nothing when times was hard i never had discussions with you begging you to help me i dealt with the repercussions of my actions i know you tried to steer me way from that *****t but that *****t was in my blood you know my life i know your momma ***** send my love in case i never get a chance to speak again i wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib thats the way i wished my family lived but my granny crib was in the jects i had to interject like ***** what you talking bout ***** is you getting at he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions but ive been having premonitions just call it visions from the other side i got a feeling i wont see tomorrow like the time im living on is borrowed with that said the only thing im proud to say i was a father write my story down and if i pass go play it for my daughter when she ready and so im leaving you this record for your eyes only dont you ever scratch or disrespect it this perspective is a real one another lost ville son i dedicate these words to you and all the other children affected by the mass incarceration in this nation that sent your pops to prison when he needed education sometimes i think this segregation wouldve done us better although i know that means i would never be brought into this world cuz my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesborough withlil zach and cole world barely one years old now its thirty years later making sure the storys told girl your daddy was a real ***** not cos he was cold not because he was the first to get some ***** twelve years old not because he used to come through in the caddy on some vogues not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving os nah your daddy was a real ***** not cos he was hard not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars not because he screamed ***** the law although that was true your daddy was a real ***** cuz he loved you for
